/**
 * Defines the contract for sophisticated `safe feature extractions` including assertion creation for the feature.
 *
 * It is similar to [FeatureAssertions] but differs in the intended usage. [FeatureAssertions] are intended to make
 * assertions about a return value of a method call or a property, regardless if this call/access fails or not.
 * The [FeatureExtractor] on the other hand should be used if it is already known, that the call/access fails depending
 * on given arguments. For instance, [List.get] is a good example where it fails if the given index is out of bounds.
